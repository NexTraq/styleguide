## NexTraq

This repo contains the NexTraq style guides, primarily based on the Google Style Guides for the relevant languages. It
does, however, also include the Vue.js style guide. Adherence to the following guides is required for submission of new
code:

*   [Java](nextraq-javaguide.html)
*   JavaScript
    *   [JS](nextraq-jsguide.html)
    *   [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/) (Non-Google guide)
*   Markdown
    *   [Google Markdown Guide](docguide/style.md)
    *   [Markdown Stye Guide](https://cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide) (Non-Google guide): Anywhere where this
        guide differs from the Google guide, the Google guide is preferred.
*   [Documentation](docguide) (Please read all documents in this folder)

Engineers are asked to read through the relevant guide before making a change in a given language. Any points that are
not mentioned or are left ambiguous in the guides are left up to the engineer’s discretion. Reviewers are also asked to
ensure that code adheres to the style guide before approving changes.

Original Google guides are left for history and comparison.

### Modifications

#### General

Constants will be named in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE. Constants will be defined as “Fields which can neither be reassigned,
nor have the values they reference changed in any way.” In other words, a field must be final, const, or whatever the
equivalent of the particular language is, and the object it points to must be fully immutable. Generally speaking, these
values will be at the top level scope (global, class, etc.). In Java, they will usually be static. If you are
considering making a constant that is not at the top level scope, please think carefully about your use case and
consider alternatives. (There are no linting configurations for this rule; it is the responsibility of the code author
and reviewer to ensure it is followed)

In addition, indent size will be 4 for all languages. This will also imply:

*   Continuation indent size is 8
*   Tab size is 4

#### JavaScript

es-module-exports: We will set the rule enforcing that only symbols used in other modules are exported to ‘warn’. In
vanilla JS, this rule is important, but it is fundamentally incompatible with Vue.js

### Formatting Tools

<!-- TODO: There are more good ones; add them -->

The first class of tools is those which automatically detect and/or fix style errors in code. It is strongly recommended
to use these tools before sending changes out for review. Do note, however, that sometimes these tools will make strange
decisions in cases where the guide leaves some level of choice up to the engineer (one particularly common case is
choosing where to break a line that is too long). As such, it is also recommended that the engineer go back over the
code after formatting to ensure it is as readable as possible.

#### IDE Google Style Config

Google provides configuration files which bring IDEs into compliance with the Google style guide, specifically for
[IntelliJ](ideconfigs/intellij-java-nextraq-style.xml) and [Eclipse](ideconfigs/eclipse-java-nextraq-style.xml) . For
IntelliJ, follow the instructions [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/copying-code-style-settings.html) to
install the style guide. For Eclipse, follow the instructions
[here](https://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Freference%2Fpreferences%2Fjava%2Fcodestyle%2Fref-preferences-formatter.htm).

#### google-java-format

This open source project provides a CLI tool, called [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format)
as well as IDE integrations for IntelliJ, Android Studio, and Eclipse. These provide both linting and automatic
formatting of Java files. This tool also has two options for integration with Gradle:
[google-java-format-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/sherter/google-java-format-gradle-plugin) and integration with a
formatting tool called
[Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/master/plugin-gradle#applying-to-java-source-google-java-format).
These provide Gradle tasks which either verify or fix formatting errors in the entire project. While the verification
task may be useful for saving time and creating presubmit hooks (more on this later), use of the formatting task is not
necessarily recommended in most cases due to the concern about odd formatting decisions mentioned above. Note that this
tool does not support configuration or modification. If we decide we want to make adjustments to the style guide, we
will need to find another tool.

#### ESLint

One of the most popular linters/formatters for JS is known as ESLint. It is configurable and configurations can be
exported and shared. The [eslint-config-google](https://github.com/google/eslint-config-google),
[eslint-plugin-vue](https://vuejs.github.io/eslint-plugin-vue/user-guide/), and
[vue-enterprise-boilerplate projects](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate) are Shareable
Configurations for ESLint which matches the Google JS and Vue.js style guides. Use of ESLint with these configs is
recommend for JS engineers.

#### Markdown

There are several tools for formatting Markdown, though none of them by default conform to the Google style guidelines.
These tools are configurable, but whether it is even possible to create a configuration that supports Google style is
even possible has not yet been investigated. They are, however, still useful for making common formatting changes such
as line length conformance. Unfortunately, no Eclipse plugin that supports automatic formatting has been found.

##### markdownlint

The primary CLI tool for formatting Markdown is markdownlint. There are three implementations of this tool: one written
in [Ruby](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint) and two written in Node.js
([markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint),
[markdownlint-cli](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli)). The most well supported is the Ruby
implementation.

##### remark

[Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-github) is a processing and linting library for Markdown built on node. It
is a bit difficult to use and the documentation is lacking, but it provides a wide array of rules as well as a framework
called plugins for extension of both rules and functionality. It can be used as a CLI, an API, or as an extension to the
[unified](https://unifiedjs.com/) in node applications.

##### Prettier

There is a style conformance tool called [Prettier](https://prettier.io) primarily intended for JS, but also has support
for Markdown. Its Markdown support relies on remark. It specifically differentiates itself from a linter, but it seems
to have a proper subset of lint functionality, as described [here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/comparison.html). It is
very easy to use and configure, and has all of the mechanisms for running that remark does. It does allow for
auto-formatting, but does so by rewriting the entire file. It is unclear whether it is possible to validate specific
lines. Prettier does not have a very extensive library of rules, in comparison to remark, and the plugins feature, which
allows for extended rulesets, is currently in beta.

##### Markdown Navigator

[Markdown Navigator](https://github.com/vsch/idea-multimarkdown) is an IntelliJ plugin which, with the paid version,
supports automatic formatting.

### Future Work

*   Add info about Swagger style conventions and formatting tools
*   Investigate Markdown formatter conformance with Google style
*   Gather and resolve opinions from other engineers on style, then
*   Document the adjustments here
*   Modify our linter/formatter configurations to reflect the adjustments
*   Investigate and implement enforcement presubmit checks
*   Investigate CI/CD role in presubmit checks

## Google Style Guides

Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions (sometimes arbitrary) about how to write
code for that project. It is much easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a consistent
style.

“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to “never use global variables” to “never use
exceptions.” This project ([google/styleguide](https://github.com/google/styleguide)) links to the style guidelines we
use for Google code. If you are modifying a project that originated at Google, you may be pointed to this page to see
the style guides that apply to that project.

This project holds the [C++ Style Guide][cpp], [Objective-C Style Guide][objc], [Java Style Guide][java],
[Python Style Guide][py], [R Style Guide][r], [Shell Style Guide][sh], [HTML/CSS Style Guide][htmlcss],
[JavaScript Style Guide][js], [AngularJS Style Guide][angular], [Common Lisp Style Guide][cl], and [Vimscript
Style Guide][vim]. This project also contains [cpplint][cpplint], a tool to assist with style guide compliance, and
[google-c-style.el][emacs], an Emacs settings file for Google style.

If your project requires that you create a new XML document format, the [XML Document Format Style Guide][xml] may be
helpful. In addition to actual style rules, it also contains advice on designing your own vs. adapting an existing
format, on XML instance document formatting, and on elements vs. attributes.

The following Google style guides live outside of this project: [Go Code Review Comments][go] and
[Effective Dart][dart].
